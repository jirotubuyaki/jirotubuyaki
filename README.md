### Welcome to Masashi OKADA's Programming! :blue_book:
My field is machine learning software and library. Especially I wish to develop bayesian nonparametric cutting age softwares. Recently I contributed to Apache PredictionIO template. It is my first pull request for Apache Software Foundation. I research and develop intelligent softwares for about 20 years. Development is my passion and my life. My hope is the realization of cutting age science tools and contribution to the international society. :exclamation: :star:

###  Bayesian Nonparametric Package for Machine Learning
We aim to develop bayesian nonparametric library by Scala & Julia. Lots of relate scientific papers are pubilshed.
We organize the papers and develop useful library. Firstly We will implement clustering methods and aim to release the first alpha version.


Thanks!!

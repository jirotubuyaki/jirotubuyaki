### Welcome to Masashi OKADA's Programming! :blue_book:
My field is machine learning software and library. Especially I wish to develop bayesian nonparametric cutting age softwares. Recently I contributed to Apache PredictionIO template. It is my first pull request for Apache Software Foundation. I research and develop intelligent softwares for about 20 years. Development is my passion and my life. My hope is the realization of cutting age science tools and contribution to the international society. :exclamation: :star:

#### Activity - Mathematics and Softwares -
* Bayesian & Bayesian Deep Learning
* Stochastic Calculus
* Mathematical Media Arts & Design
* Programming (Recently Scala, Julia, R, C++)

#### Recent Results
* Apache PredictionIO Pull Requests (Bayesian Nonparametric Chinese Restaurant Process Clustering)  [[URL]](https://github.com/apache/predictionio/pull/458)
* R package CRAN accept (Monte Carlo Option Pricing Algorithms for Jump Diffusion Models with Correlational Companies)  [[URL]](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Jdmbs/index.html)


#### Project in Progress
* Bayesian library by Julia & Scala. My purpose is contributing to the open source AI community.  

Thanks!!
